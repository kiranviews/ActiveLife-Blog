        <h2><b>Nothing Without The Fans</b></h2>
        <p>Football without the fans has never been the same. With fans, stadiums have been nothing short of a fortress. 
            With competitions like Champions League that have the home and away game concepts, the fans played a crucial 
            part in the performance of the players on the pitch. Sports are very closely tied to the psychological aspects 
            of the players. With thousands of fans and their undying display of passion from the stands, it has always been 
            the biggest morale boost for the home team players and also the biggest nightmare for the away team players. 
            With fans roaring away to cheer on their team, we have seen great comebacks.
        </p>
        <p>This season of Premier League took place with no fans attending the matches live, it was rather a boring 
            season as the general enthusiasm was rather low. The pandemic caused a huge blow and it really did affect 
            the morale of the players. Without fans coming in, the revenue that clubs get from the sale of tickets and 
            kits has also gone down. Clubs generally across the league, especially those lower league teams are struggling 
            to support their staffs and players. With players demanding for higher wages, we saw clubs retrenching staffs 
            and even not being able to make their signings in the transfer windows. 
        </p>
        <p> With the next premier league 21/22 season starting in August, fans can finally return to the stadiums 
            to support their teams. This season will be an extremely interesting one to watch. Will the crowned Premier League 
            champions, Man City, be able to keep up their winning streak? We will see Champions League winners Chelsea going for 
            a winning streak while a fully stacked Liverpool Team will be coming back to take revenge for their injuries from the 
            previous season. Let's all hope for a better, more intense, adrenaline pumping season.

        <h2><b>Basketball and its benefits</b></h2>
        <p>Basketball is a really interesting and intense sport. 
            It is very popular across every age group. Exercising can be seen as a monotonous, boring thing. 
            However, we can exercise by playing team sports. Playing with a group of people not only makes 
            exercising a more sociable and enjoyable process, it reduces the idea of looking at exercise as 
            a chore. It is also an easier way to get people to exercise.
        </p>
        <p>Basketball requires high stamina and agility. It is not a static sport. It is highly dynamic and 
            requires the players to be constantly on their toes. It also requires high endurance. With two teams 
            needing to shoot hoops across the court, the game demands players to constantly run back and forth. So, 
            players constantly need to be running at high speeds to score the points and to defend too. By playing 
            basketball, you are not only doing cardio, you are also working on your upper-body strength. Basketball 
            requires quick and precise movements. Players need to make sharp turns and maintain their stamina throughout 
            the game. When playing a game of basketball, you will need to run back and forth and change your directions 
            quickly. This proves how playing basketball improves your balance and coordination. With proper balance, players 
            can maintain stability and not leave gaps in the defence.
        </p>
        <p>Playing sports in general improves your mental well-being. Any team sport requires good team building. 
            One man cannot bring upon victory. Hence, playing heavily strategic and intense games like Basketball helps 
            us work on our social skills. It helps us to learn to communicate in tough situations, to keep calm and to be 
            adaptive in challenging situations.  Constant practice and seeing visible improvement in your game performance 
            also boosts your confidence when you get your shots in or make that pass that leads to the win. It also reduces 
            your stress and makes you feel good about yourself. So, it's time you try shooting hoops as your new hobby.

        <h2><b>Olympics in the pandemic</b></h2>
        <p>The Olympics is a symbol of 125-years of international unity. It's the global event that unites the world 
            with sports. With Japan hosting the 2020 Olympics, everyone was excited to explore the rich japanese 
            culture while enjoying the olympics. Japan is rich in history. It is a popular holiday destination in 
            Asia. Beautiful sceneries, amazing food and an incredible night life are some of the examples for people 
            to choose Japan as a  holiday destination.
        </p>
        <p>However, with the breakout of the global covid pandemic, the sporting world came to a huge halt and the 
            olympics got pushed to 2021. Japan was slow in the vaccination process. To make the situation worse, the 
            sudden surge in the spread of the Delta variant of the virus made the pandemic even more difficult to 
            handle. With Japan still battling the covid crisis, the government and the olympics committee took the 
            responsible decisions of holding the event without the fans. This was a really heartbreaking decision as
            even the locals were not allowed to watch the games live. No fans from across the world could support 
            their country’s athletes. This global sporting event eventually became a closed doors event. Without the 
            moral support from the fans, the athletes will be having a rather different and even a mentally taxing 
            olympic experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While this decision seems to be a smart option, it also will take a huge hit in the tourist sector of 
            Japan. Sporting events like this usually help to boost a country’s economy as many tourists across the 
            globe come to visit the hosting country. This Olympics will definitely be a very special one in the 
            history books and we are excited to witness it from the comfort of our homes. Though the pandemic has 
            placed the world in a really negative space, this Olympics shall bring us all together and to show our 
            support and love and celebrate life through sports.
