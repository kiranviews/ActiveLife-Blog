        <h2><b>Battle against a Pandemic</b></h2>
        <p> Covid-19 has evolved into a global pandemic that has negatively impacted all our lives and destroyed our normality. 
            It has changed the way the world operates. The entire world is now working towards getting itself vaccinated. 
            Countries across the globe has intensified the vaccination process to build global herd immunity. 
            However, people are still afraid to get the vaccine or are not aware of the importance of getting vaccinated. 
            Why should you get vaccinated? Getting the vaccine reduces the risk of infection. With local unlinked cases spreading, 
            it's important that we get vaccinated to protect ourselves and the people around us. Getting the vaccine not only protects us against severe illness, it also helps us recover in the case if we get covid-19. So, please book your vaccination and 
            proceed to your nearby vaccination center and get the jab. Get your family and friends to also get the vaccination. 
            We need to play our part to win this battle against this deadly pandemic.

        <h2><b>Boost Your Immunity</b></h2>
        <p> Living in a pandemic is not easy. We need to stay fit and maintain our health. The most important thing is to focus on our immunity and boost it. 
            It is not a very difficult thing to do and we can do it naturally by doing simple things on an everyday basis. Firstly, get proper sleep. Adults should  
            get 7 or more hours of sleep each night, while teens need 8â€“10 hours and younger children and infants up to 14 hours. Next, eat healthy. Consume food rich in vitamin C like citrus fruits. 
            Make sure you also stay hydrated. Drinking water and staying hydrated is an often underlooked aspect. Eat more fermented food like yoghurt which is rich in beneficial bacteria called probiotics. 
            It helps you maintain healthy gut bacteria. Make sure to also exercise and to maintain your stress levels.

        <h2><b>Focus on your mental health</b></h2>
        <p> Physical health and mental health are closely related. For example, many medical research has proved that  depression 
            leads to heart and vascular diseases. Mental disorders also affect  a person's health behaviour like eating properly, 
            exercising regularly, sleeping properly etc. This will eventually lead to greater physical health risks. Not focusing 
            on your mental health also affects your societal presence as it leads to social problems like unemployment and problems
            among family and friends. It also causes a negative impact on your immune system. So, it's time that we start reflecting 
            on our mental health. Don't overlook it. Talk to a trusted, loved one when feeling stressed or depressed. When the problem 
            gets too much to handle, get professional help. It's time we also keep our minds healthy like how we work on our fitness.
