        <h2><b>The power of Books</b></h2>
        <p>Reading is the most powerful habit that one can develop. Knowledge is the torch of life and reading is the biggest tool that can help you with it. Our education system has cultivated this habit in us since young but as we grow older, with work and other commitments, we find it hard to put aside some time to read. 
           Reading books helps us to gain new insights and learn from peopleâ€™s experiences that the author was written about. Reading expands our vocabulary and also allows us to improve our language proficiency. 
           Go to your nearby bookstore and get yourself a book. Head down to your local library and borrow a book that grabs your attention. It can be any book, fiction or nonfiction. Give yourself 15minutes everyday to read. 
           Start cultivating this powerful habit. Keep a journal and write down the things that you learnt about while reading and also encourage your family and friends to join in. Start Reading!

        <h2><b>Learn to Code</b></h2>
        <p>The Digital Era is here and it's going to revolutionise the way the world is going to function. In a few years time, your job might be at the risk of being replaced by a robot or being digitised. Are you ready to face this digital transformation? 
           The time is here for everyone to start learning how to code. Coding is not only for software engineers and data analysts. It's an important skill set that is extremely important in the current working world. Learning how to code will help you understand the new technologies in a deeper way and will allow you to keep yourself updated. 
           You can learn how to digitise your ideas and businesses which will help you in the future and even during tough times like a pandemic. So, we highly encourage you to start learning how to code. There are many online tutorials like Codecademy and Udemy that will give you step-by-step guidance on learning a programming language. So, our recommendation is to start learning Python. 
           It's a relatively simple yet powerful language that is commonly used in many big software companies like Google.
