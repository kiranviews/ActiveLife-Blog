        <h2><b>Now Trending: Valorant</b></h2>
        <img src="images/valorant.jpg" alt="valorant", width="300" height="300">
        <p>Valorant is a relatively new multiplayer First Person Shooter (FPS) game which is 
            trending globally. This game, developed by Riot Games,  was able to compete with the 
            extremely popular FPS game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive.This game which is similar 
            to Overwatch, has attracted a huge fanbase as it is highly intense and extremely 
            competitive. It is also a really fun game to play with your friends, thanks to its 
            intricate maps and a diverse range of agents that can suit the various game styles of 
            the various gamers. 
        </p>
        <p>This extremely intense game pushes players to their limits as it is highly intricate. 
            Learning to use the agents requires a steep learning curve as the different agents 
            have different abilities and playing styles. Hence, players would have to try out the 
            various agents and pick a character that best suits them and their play style. The 
            maps are also very vast. The maps are created in a way where various agents  
            can exploit the different areas of the maps and use the various agentâ€™s abilities to 
            take down the enemies.
       </p>
       <p>The competitive round sees which team will win in the 13 rounds. This game is all about 
           teamwork and communication. Teammates must choose agents that will compliment each 
           other and know where to go and set up turrets and traps in the maps. This Free to Play 
           game is worth trying. So, grab a few friends and check this game out this weekend!

        <h2><b>FIFA: Team of the Week</b></h2>
        <p>Inspired by the top performing players from the Euros 2020 and Copa America,
            we have put together a highly rated team that will be lethal in all areas of the
            pitch. Featuring England's leading attackers, Kane and Sterling, we have paired
            them up with the Brazilian Superstar Neymar Jr. We have chosen Chiellini as the
            center back after his brilliant performance and also Sommer as the keeper for his quick
            reflexes and dives. Try out this team today for your next Squad Battles and FUT Champ!<p>
